# Installation & Updates

## Installation

You can download the latest release from the "Assets" section of the [latest release](https://github.com/Blesmol/pfscf/releases/latest).
Currently there are zipped packages for Windows, macOS/Darwin and Linux.
Download the release for your currently used operating system and extract into a new folder.
The important things in this directory are the `pfscf` executable and the `templates` directory.
The executable is, of course, the program to run this whole thing, whereas the `templates` directory contains the configuration files for the chronicle sheets, so that the program knows what to print where on the resulting sheet.

The program itself is a command line application.
This means that e.g. on Windows you have to use the Windows command prompt or the Windows PowerShell to run this.
You should also find a file `openCmdHere.bat` in the installation directory that will on windows open a cmd prompt window in the directory where the program is installed.

## Updates

At the moment I would propose to simply delete the directory that contains the old version of the program and follow the [installation instructions](#installation) again.
